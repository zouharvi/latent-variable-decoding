# Laten Variable Decoding

This is just a utils support repository for the main project.
Contact [Eleanor](https://www.elejiang.me/) for more details.

Run `./src/t5minimize_qg.py` and `./src/t5minimize_e2e.py` to create corresponding files in `./data`.
This also checks that `QTDataProcessor` and `E2EDataProcessor` (imported from `./src/qg_tensorizer.py` and `./src/e2e_tensorizer.py`) can load successfully.
